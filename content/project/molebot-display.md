#### About
Ambient displays that use natural objects and phenomena as displays in real space have been studied.  
These ambient displays can present information suitable for the human living environment by using natural physical phenomena as metaphors.
In this study, we propose the "Molebot Display," which displays information by controlling a small robot and using an iron sand as a display.
In the Molebot Display, a small robot is equipped with a mechanism that moves a magnet up and down, and the robot controls the projection of iron sand by moving the magnet up and down at the bottom of a container of iron sand.
