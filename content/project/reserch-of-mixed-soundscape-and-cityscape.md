#### About
We created an interactive art "Mixed Soundscape and Cityscape". This artwork provide users an experience for rearrangement and 
observation of the environmental sounds, providing users with an opportunity to rethink the region based on the placement of these sounds.
The users move the objects, which correspond to environmental sounds, on the table to reconfigure the soundscape and appreciate them.
This artwork exhibited at the "TAMAable Exhibition" held in Tama City, Tokyo, Japan.
